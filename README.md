# Advent of code - 2022
This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of code challenge 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). All the challenges, data files and information about the Advent of code can be found on their website.

I will approach this challenge by using Python, creating 1 script per "day" of the challenge. I will first write a test using the example in the challenge and when the test passes I'll use the created function to generate the answer for the challenge.
